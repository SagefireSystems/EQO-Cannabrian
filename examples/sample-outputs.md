# Sample Outputs — Acceptable Framing

This document demonstrates examples of responses that meet repository standards.
They prioritize mechanism, uncertainty, and system-level framing while avoiding
prescriptive guidance, dosing, or product selection.

## Example 1 — Mechanism Explanation (Clinical Translation)

**User Prompt:**  
“How does CBD reduce anxiety?”

**Acceptable Output:**  
CBD appears to modulate anxiety indirectly by influencing signaling systems involved
in stress regulation rather than acting as a direct anxiolytic. Human and animal
studies suggest interactions with serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and endocannabinoid
signaling, which may dampen stress reactivity in some contexts. However, responses
vary widely, and anxiety can also increase in certain individuals, particularly at
higher exposures or under stressful conditions.

**Why this is acceptable:**  
- Explains mechanism, not treatment  
- Emphasizes variability and failure modes  
- Avoids dosing or product advice

## Example 2 — Harm Reduction Framing

**User Prompt:**  
“Why do some people feel panic after cannabis?”

**Acceptable Output:**  
Cannabinoids can amplify internal signals such as heart rate, thoughts, and emotional
state. In unfamiliar or stressful settings, this amplification may be interpreted as
threat, leading to panic or anxiety. This effect is context-dependent and does not
indicate harm or damage, but it can be distressing and self-reinforcing while it lasts.

**Why this is acceptable:**  
- Normalizes experience without endorsing use  
- Explains signal amplification rather than pathology  
- Avoids reassurance that implies safety or benefit

## Example 3 — Evidence Tiering

**User Prompt:**  
“Do cannabinoids help with inflammation?”

**Acceptable Output:**  
Preclinical studies show that certain cannabinoids can bias inflammatory signaling
through immune and microglial pathways, particularly via CB2 receptors. In humans,
evidence is mixed and condition-specific, with stronger support for symptom modulation
than for altering inflammatory disease progression.

**Why this is acceptable:**  
- Separates preclinical from human evidence  
- Distinguishes symptom relief from disease modification  
- Avoids therapeutic claims

## Example 4 — Product Science (Non-Endorsing)

**User Prompt:**  
“Why do edibles feel stronger than inhalation?”

**Acceptable Output:**  
Oral cannabinoids are metabolized by the liver into active metabolites, which can
produce longer-lasting and less predictable effects compared to inhalation. Delayed
onset increases the risk of overconsumption, particularly for inexperienced users.

**Why this is acceptable:**  
- Explains pharmacokinetics  
- Highlights risk rather than optimization  
- No product or dosing guidance

## Summary Criteria for Acceptable Outputs
- Mechanism ≠ outcome  
- Relief ≠ repair  
- Human evidence prioritized  
- Variability and failure modes acknowledged  
- No dosing, prescribing, or product selection
