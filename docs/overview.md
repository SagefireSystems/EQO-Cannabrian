# Overview

EQO: Cannabrain is an evidence-disciplined framework for translating cannabinoid science without overclaiming, prescribing, or optimizing.

It exists to solve a specific problem: **most cannabinoid information fails not because it is wrong, but because it is misinterpreted**.

This project focuses on preventing those failure modes.

---

## Why this framework exists

Cannabinoid science is unusually vulnerable to distortion due to:

* high individual variability of effects
* strong expectancy and context dependence
* rapid translation of preclinical findings into public claims
* commercial pressure toward optimization narratives
* confusion between symptom relief and disease modification

EQO: Cannabrain addresses these risks by enforcing **claim discipline**, **boundary clarity**, and **failure-mode awareness** across all outputs.

---

## What problem it does *not* try to solve

This framework is intentionally limited.

It does not attempt to:

* tell individuals what to take, how much, or when
* recommend or compare products or delivery devices
* provide treatment plans or therapeutic advice
* convert emerging science into guaranteed outcomes

These omissions are deliberate safeguards, not gaps.

---

## Core framing principles

All content produced under this framework follows a small number of non-negotiable ideas:

* **Cannabinoids are signal modulators, not repair agents**
  They alter signal intensity and salience; they do not fix systems.

* **Relief is not repair**
  Symptom modulation must not be framed as disease modification.

* **Repeated buffering is not adaptation**
  Short-term relief does not imply long-term benefit.

* **Context determines outcome**
  Physiology, stress load, expectations, environment, and formulation all matter.

## Translation tracks

EQO: Cannabrain routes explanations through five calibrated tracks, each with explicit scope limits:

1. **Clinical & Therapeutic Translation**
   Mechanisms and risk framing for medically literate audiences.

2. **Harm Reduction & Real-World Use**
   Anxiety, panic, and impairment risk framing without medicalization.

3. **Policy, Public Health & Regulation**
   Population-level evidence interpretation and legal literacy.

4. **Product, Formulation & Delivery Science**
   How chemistry and delivery alter effects, without endorsement.

5. **Advanced Systems & Research**
   Systems integration and open questions, without speculative claims.

Crossing track boundaries is not permitted.

## Boundaries are the system

The most important file in this repository is **`docs/boundaries.md`**.

It defines:

* hard prohibitions (no dosing, no products, no treatment plans)
* required failure-mode acknowledgment
* evidence hierarchy enforcement
* interaction and impairment framing rules

These constraints are structural. They apply regardless of audience, intent, or perceived benefit.

---

## How to use this repository

For first-time readers:

1. Read this overview
2. Read `docs/boundaries.md`
3. Review `docs/tracks.md`
4. Examine `examples/redline-tests.md`

If the boundaries feel restrictive, the framework is working as intended.

---

## Intended audience

This project is designed for:

* clinicians and health educators
* harm reduction educators
* policy and regulatory analysts
* researchers and advanced learners
* AI system designers working in regulated domains

It is not optimized for consumer guidance or lifestyle optimization.

---

## Design philosophy

EQO: Cannabrain prioritizes:

* preventing harm over maximizing reassurance
* preserving uncertainty over simplifying narratives
* explaining limits as clearly as mechanisms

When in doubt, the framework defaults to **restraint**.

---

## If you take one thing away

Cannabinoids can change experience.
They do not fix systems.

Understanding that distinction prevents more harm than any single claimed benefit.
