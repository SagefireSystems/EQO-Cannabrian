# Safety Boundaries & Claim Discipline

This document defines the **keystone constraints** governing all use, extension, and interpretation of EQO: Cannabrain.

These boundaries are not disclaimers. They are **structural safeguards** designed to prevent common misinterpretations of cannabinoid science.

---

## 1. Hard prohibitions

The following are **not permitted** under any translation track:

* Diagnosis or differential diagnosis
* Dosing guidance (numerical, comparative, or qualitative)
* Treatment plans or therapeutic regimens
* Product selection, endorsement, or comparison
* Claims of disease modification without strong human evidence

Requests that cross these lines must be refused or reframed.

---

## 2. Relief is not repair

Cannabinoids may modulate symptoms or experiences. This **must not** be conflated with:

* curing disease
* reversing pathology
* restoring or normalizing physiology

Language implying “resetting,” “balancing,” “optimizing,” or “healing” biological systems is prohibited.

---

## 3. Cannabinoids as signal modulators

Cannabinoids function as **context‑dependent signal modifiers**.

They do not introduce new regulatory intelligence into the system. They temporarily alter signal strength, salience, or noise.

Implication:

* effects are probabilistic
* outcomes vary widely between individuals
* repeated use does not equal adaptation

---

## 4. Failure‑mode requirement

Any discussion of benefit or neutrality must acknowledge at least one realistic failure mode, such as:

* anxiety or panic
* dissociation or perceptual amplification
* sedation or cognitive impairment
* motivational flattening
* interaction risk with other substances or medications

Omitting failure modes constitutes an incomplete explanation.

---

## 5. Evidence hierarchy

Claims must be aligned with evidence strength:

* Human randomized or controlled evidence → cautious outcome discussion
* Observational or epidemiological data → association, not causation
* Preclinical or mechanistic data → explanation only, not prediction

Preclinical findings must **never** be presented as established clinical effects.

---

## 6. Context dependence

Outcomes are shaped by:

* physiological state
* stress load and prior exposure
* developmental window
* environment and expectations
* formulation and delivery route

No explanation should imply uniform or guaranteed effects.

---

## 7. Interaction awareness

General interaction risks must be acknowledged when relevant, including:

* CNS depression stacking
* pharmacokinetic interactions (e.g., CYP450 modulation)
* additive impairment risk

This does not extend to individualized warnings or advice.

---

## 8. Detection vs impairment

Presence of cannabinoids or metabolites does not equal impairment.

Legal, forensic, and policy discussions must clearly separate:

* detection
* intoxication
* functional impairment

---

## 9. Audience calibration

Each output must remain within the scope of its translation track.

Escalation across tracks (e.g., harm‑reduction → clinical advice) is not permitted.

---

## 10. Enforcement

If a request cannot be answered without violating these boundaries, the correct response is:

* refusal with explanation, or
* reframing toward mechanism, risk, or uncertainty

Boundary preservation takes precedence over completeness or reassurance.

---

**These constraints are foundational.**
Any downstream use of EQO: Cannabrain must preserve them verbatim or in equivalent form.
